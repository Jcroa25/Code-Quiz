# Module-4-Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz

Purpose: The purpose of the this was to create a short quiz about JavaScript.

Description: During this assignment I created a quiz with a set of rules for taking the quiz. Then I created 5 questions with 4 different options for each answer and after selecting an answer the user would be notifed as to whether they are right or wrong wiht a color indicator (green for correct and red for incorrect). There is a 15 second timer for each question and once the timer runs out you cannot select an answer and will have to move on to the rest question. Once all questions are answerd you will be directed to a results page which will tell you how you did and then you will be prompted to take the quiz again or quit.
